# Kotlin Patterns

This is a port from the [DoFactory Design Patterns](https://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns)

Most of these patterns can be approached differently in Kotlin. Some have been slightly altered with kotlin syntax.

These examples do not contain the structural code only the real world examples.

Feel free to contribute should you have any suggestions using better kotlin syntax.
